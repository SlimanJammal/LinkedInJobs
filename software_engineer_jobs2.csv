Are you ready to redefine the landscape of software development with AI at your fingertips? Trilogy is on the hunt for pioneering spirits. As we embrace an AI-First approach, we're not just adapting to the future—we're creating it. If you see AI as your ally, ready to augment your every task and unlock new realms of efficiency and creativity, this is your arena.

In the vast expanse of software engineering, only a select few dare to tread where technology meets untapped potential. At Trilogy, we're offering more than a job; we're offering a revolution. A place where AI doesn't replace you but elevates you to a status akin to a sorcerer of code—conjuring solutions, debugging spells, and engineering marvels at a pace and precision beyond mere mortal reach.

This isn't just software development; it's software development reborn. You'll build AI Second Brains that distill domains into essence, wielding RAG vector stores as your crystal ball to foresee and fix bugs before they hatch.

What You Won’t Be Doing

Manual Debugging Drudgery: Forget the old ways of debugging. You're equipped with AI to spot and solve issues effortlessly.
Commanding the Front Lines, Not Muddling through Management: Here, your genius lies in weaving code into solutions, not in marshaling troops or being stuck in project management meetings.

Transform software development with AI augmentation, leading Trilogy's products to new heights of innovation, efficiency, and user experience.

Basic Requirements

At least 2 years of experience in software development
Proficiency in Java and C#.

AWS Utility Computing (UC) provides product innovations — from foundational services such as Amazon's Simple Storage Service (S3) and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), to consistently released new product innovations that continue to set AWS's services and features apart in the industry. As a member of the UC organization, you'll support the development and management of Compute, Database, Storage, Internet of Things (Iot), Platform, and Productivity Apps services in AWS. Within AWS UC, Amazon Dedicated Cloud (ADC) roles engage with AWS customers who require specialized security solutions for their cloud services.

Annapurna Labs, an Amazon company, plays a significant role in AWS's success with developing Graviton servers.

Graviton servers are ARM-based processors that provide better performance and cost-effectiveness for running various compute-intensive applications on the cloud.

As a Python Software Development Engineer in our team, you will be responsible for the Graviton servers' software quality.

That includes setting up and maintenance of lab and cloud environments, writing test-plans, automating them and troubleshooting issues.

You will take part in designing, developing, and maintaining our automation frameworks and will work closely with developers to ensure the timely delivery of high-quality Graviton servers to our customers.

As a part of this team, you will solve difficult technical problems, work on test frameworks, test tools, and test case automation for large components. You will build and apply solutions that assess and mitigate quality risks on the Graviton servers.

For more about Annapurna, see the 2020 Re:Invent keynote:

About Rhino Health
AI has not achieved its full potential in healthcare. Rhino Health aims to fix that.

This platform uses edge computing and federated learning, leaving data at rest at each site, thus lowering the barrier to wider adoption of AI in healthcare and making multi-site collaboration seamless. Users can collaborate with a network of dozens of leading medical centers around the world, centrally performing data pre-processing, harmonization, model training & validation, and results analysis with no patient data ever leaving any medical center’s firewall.
 The company is headquartered in Boston, with an R&D center in Tel Aviv.

About this role:

Via is using technology to transform transportation around the world. From changing a single person’s daily commute to reducing humanity’s collective environmental footprint — we’ve got huge goals.

We are looking for an Senior Backend Software Engineer to join our R&D office in Tel Aviv. The position is to be part of a Development team responsible for Via’s production quality, cutting-edge server software and scalable, robust infrastructure to manage all of Via configurations. The goal of our team is to make Via’s service more stable, and simple - and soon to open to partners the ability to configure their own service, using our system. You will work on challenging tasks such as stability enhancements, security improvements, infra updates, and other significant tasks that have a direct impact on Via's services.

What You’ll Do:

Solve challenging tasks our system is facing, and elevate its contribution to Via’s services.
Transform mostly internal systems into partner ready in terms of stability, security, scale and integrated.
Defining and implementing effective cloud infrastructure scaling solutions based on best-in-class standard tools.

Who You Are:

5+ years of professional backend programming experience - must (Python is a plus).
Experience working on several systems with different architectures. 
Fast learner: you can quickly master concepts, disciplines and methods.
Team Player, great communication skills 
 Experience with Javascript and React - Advantage. 
Familiar with cloud-based deployment (Preferred: AWS) - Advantage .

Concise: you get stuff done, in a simple, elegant way.

We’re Via, and we build technology that changes the way the world moves. We pioneered the TransitTech category to ensure that the future of transportation is shared, dynamic public mobility — the kind that reduces carbon emissions across congested cities, minimizes reliance on private cars, and provides everyone with accessible, efficient, and affordable ways of getting around.

We created the first end-to-end TransitTech solution for cities and transit agencies, offering world-class software, service design, and operational expertise to fundamentally improve the way the world moves.

Via was founded with the guiding principle that we go further when we go together. We are dedicated to building a diverse, inclusive and authentic workplace. If you’re excited about this role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every qualification in the job description, we encourage you to apply anyways. You may be just the right candidate for this or other roles. All backgrounds, identities, and voices are welcomed and celebrated at Via.

PTC is looking for hands-on engineer, experienced with site reliability and operations, for a leading PLM SaaS solution.

Your Day-to-Day Work

Automation

SRE engineers build tools for automation to manage platform operations. Thus, instead of manually performing these functions, their aim is to automate them. Such functions include:

Continuous delivery, and Deployment
Toil reduction, and operations automation
Monitoring
Rapid Incident response
Alerts


Monitoring

SRE engineers are responsible for ensuring that the underlying infrastructure is running smoothly, and that systems and tools are working as expected.

They also monitor critical applications and services to minimize downtime and ensure their availability.

Issue resolution

The engineer works closely with developers, especially when issues arise so they will collaborate with developers to help with troubleshooting and provide consultation when alerts are issued.

This engineer will investigate and then resolve the issue in the event that a developer runs into a problem. Following the incident resolution, the engineer will revisit the issue and determine the cause to ensure it doesn’t happen again.

Cross team collaboration

Based on the above, SREs work across different teams, mainly operations and development. By building reliable systems and providing support to these teams, this will give these teams more time to divert their attention to building new features and hence get these out faster to customers.

Requirements

Must-Have Skills

Hands-On experience an SRE gains working with developers and customers for 3-5 years of SRE Skill:

Experience building automated monitoring tools like Datadog, Dynatrace, Splunk, SumoLogic etc
Experience in Logging/Monitoring/Insights: Zabbix, Grafana, Azure Monitoring, Open Telemetry
Experienced with tools like, ServiceNow, PagerDuty, CatchPoint, PingDom
Perform Root Cause Analysis and write Runbooks – a must
Well versed with Application, Platform and Operation security.
Should have a profound working knowledge of Cloud-native technologies especially on Azure cloud, and should be abreast of IaaS, PaaS Services with appropriate backup, rollback, HA/DR technologies.
Must possess deep working knowledge of infrastructure on IAM solutions, AAD/LDAP, Networking – DNS, Firewall, Gateway, Load Balancers, storage etc – an advantage
Must be proficient, and skilled in programming/scripting with Java, Go, Python, shell, or groovy scripting. Familiarity with DSLs like Yaml is expected.
Practical experience working, and troubleshooting with Oracle – an advantage
Build Config Management and deployment tooling viz SaltStack/Ansible, Terraform, ARM.


Life at PTC is about more than working with today’s most cutting-edge technologies to transform the physical world. It’s about showing up as you are and working alongside some of today’s most talented industry leaders to transform the world around you.

If you share our passion for problem-solving through innovation, you’ll likely become just as passionate about the PTC experience as we are. Are you ready to explore your next career move with us?

HUMAN was founded in 2012 in a Brooklyn sci-fi bookstore by Tamer Hassan, Michael Tiffany, Dan Kaminsky, and Ash Kalb. Our humble beginnings led to the creation of the Human Defense Platform, the backbone of all our products that safeguards enterprises from sophisticated bots, fraud, and account abuse. Today we verify the humanity of more than 20 trillion interactions per week for some of the largest companies and internet platforms. 

Our hacker roots still permeate everything we do. You will be a part of the HUMAN front line in our commitment to protecting companies (and in turn, their customers) from both revenue and reputation risk caused by digital attacks. However, HUMAN is not the center of this story. Humans like yourself are. We firmly believe in putting people first. This approach spans our extensive total rewards package, inclusive of competitive compensation, benefits, stipends - as well as our day-to-day culture - to ensure every human is empowered to do the best work of their life. We want to hear about the marathon you’re training for. We want to see pictures of your pets. We want to know your favorite robot (we have many).

 Even if you’re not a conventional “hacker” we can assure you that you are a hacker in your own right. We want to work with people like you who break down problems to build up better solutions. That’s what makes us HUMAN. You’ll be joining us at an exciting moment in the HUMAN story: we joined forces with PerimeterX in a market-changing merger , as well as recently acquired clean.io to enhance the Human Defense Platform. Together under the HUMAN brand, we will disrupt the economics of cybercrime. We hope you can join us in that mission.

We’re looking for a strong ML engineer to join our team and help lead the development of our ML infrastructure. If you’re passionate about ML, Python and high-scale big-data environments, come join the team!

What you'll do:

Lead the development of our ML Ops infrastructure, creating processes that support ML projects in the company from their development phase until their deployment to production and beyond.
Build and support an infrastructure for real-time model inference at scale, serving billions of requests each day.
Implement data-based processes and solutions processing massive amounts of data as part of our ML pipelines.
Work closely with our data scientists to deliver new projects, define processes and coding standards and gather requirements to further develop our infra.
Design and implement pipelines integrating ML models and prediction results into our core products.
Be the go-to person for any Python or ML Ops related question or idea, being a focal point for both our Research and engineering teams.


Who you are:

5+ years of backend development in Python. 
Has experience developing ML Ops processes or supporting ML models in production.
Experienced with big-data, high-scale environments. 
Familiar with cloud vendors concepts and tools, preferably working on top of one in prior positions.
Team player with good verbal and written communication skills. 
Passionate about technology, fast learner and eager to lead and take ownership of big projects end-to-end.
Prior experience working with GCP - advantage.
Golang knowledge and experience - advantage.
Experience with Vertex AI and Kubeflow pipelines - advantage.


HUMAN prides itself on being an equal opportunity workplace. We firmly believe in putting people first regardless of who you are, where you come from, how you identify, or who your favorite robot is (we have many). We are on a mission to protect the integrity of the internet for everyone, so we welcome all individuals to come to share their unique experiences and perspectives as we fight against cybercrime together!

With Humans located in all parts of the world, we’ve fully embraced our diversity of thought and are always looking for innovative ways to connect with one another - even in virtual reality! Although New York City is our HQ, we have teams in Tel Aviv, Israel; London, UK; Victoria, Canada; San Mateo, CA; Miami, FL; and Virginia.

We trust our Humans in choosing where they work and how they work. The total rewards package we provide reflects our commitment to our Humans’ personal career development, which includes annual stipends for home office setup, wellbeing, and learning & development. We also offer weekly lunches, flexible time off, no-meeting Fridays (for our U.S. and Intl. based HUMANs), HUMAN days, and so much more.

We’re constantly trying to anticipate the needs of our Humans to ensure each one of us is equally prepared to do some of the best work of our life. Taking care of one another is part of the HUMAN experience and how we build true HUMAN connections.
