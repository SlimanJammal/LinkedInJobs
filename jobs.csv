HUMAN was founded in 2012 in a Brooklyn sci-fi bookstore by Tamer Hassan, Michael Tiffany, Dan Kaminsky, and Ash Kalb. Our humble beginnings led to the creation of the Human Defense Platform, the backbone of all our products that safeguards enterprises from sophisticated bots, fraud, and account abuse. Today we verify the humanity of more than 20 trillion interactions per week for some of the largest companies and internet platforms. 

Our hacker roots still permeate everything we do. You will be a part of the HUMAN front line in our commitment to protecting companies (and in turn, their customers) from both revenue and reputation risk caused by digital attacks. However, HUMAN is not the center of this story. Humans like yourself are. We firmly believe in putting people first. This approach spans our extensive total rewards package, inclusive of competitive compensation, benefits, stipends - as well as our day-to-day culture - to ensure every human is empowered to do the best work of their life. We want to hear about the marathon you’re training for. We want to see pictures of your pets. We want to know your favorite robot (we have many).

 Even if you’re not a conventional “hacker” we can assure you that you are a hacker in your own right. We want to work with people like you who break down problems to build up better solutions. That’s what makes us HUMAN. You’ll be joining us at an exciting moment in the HUMAN story: we joined forces with PerimeterX in a market-changing merger , as well as recently acquired clean.io to enhance the Human Defense Platform. Together under the HUMAN brand, we will disrupt the economics of cybercrime. We hope you can join us in that mission.

We’re looking for a strong ML engineer to join our team and help lead the development of our ML infrastructure. If you’re passionate about ML, Python and high-scale big-data environments, come join the team!

What you'll do:

Lead the development of our ML Ops infrastructure, creating processes that support ML projects in the company from their development phase until their deployment to production and beyond.
Build and support an infrastructure for real-time model inference at scale, serving billions of requests each day.
Implement data-based processes and solutions processing massive amounts of data as part of our ML pipelines.
Work closely with our data scientists to deliver new projects, define processes and coding standards and gather requirements to further develop our infra.
Design and implement pipelines integrating ML models and prediction results into our core products.
Be the go-to person for any Python or ML Ops related question or idea, being a focal point for both our Research and engineering teams.


Who you are:

5+ years of backend development in Python. 
Has experience developing ML Ops processes or supporting ML models in production.
Experienced with big-data, high-scale environments. 
Familiar with cloud vendors concepts and tools, preferably working on top of one in prior positions.
Team player with good verbal and written communication skills. 
Passionate about technology, fast learner and eager to lead and take ownership of big projects end-to-end.
Prior experience working with GCP - advantage.
Golang knowledge and experience - advantage.
Experience with Vertex AI and Kubeflow pipelines - advantage.


HUMAN prides itself on being an equal opportunity workplace. We firmly believe in putting people first regardless of who you are, where you come from, how you identify, or who your favorite robot is (we have many). We are on a mission to protect the integrity of the internet for everyone, so we welcome all individuals to come to share their unique experiences and perspectives as we fight against cybercrime together!

With Humans located in all parts of the world, we’ve fully embraced our diversity of thought and are always looking for innovative ways to connect with one another - even in virtual reality! Although New York City is our HQ, we have teams in Tel Aviv, Israel; London, UK; Victoria, Canada; San Mateo, CA; Miami, FL; and Virginia.

We trust our Humans in choosing where they work and how they work. The total rewards package we provide reflects our commitment to our Humans’ personal career development, which includes annual stipends for home office setup, wellbeing, and learning & development. We also offer weekly lunches, flexible time off, no-meeting Fridays (for our U.S. and Intl. based HUMANs), HUMAN days, and so much more.

We’re constantly trying to anticipate the needs of our Humans to ensure each one of us is equally prepared to do some of the best work of our life. Taking care of one another is part of the HUMAN experience and how we build true HUMAN connections.

Experience communicating and working across functions to drive solutions

Preferred Qualifications:

MSc or PhD degree in Computer Graphics, Computer Science, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Robotics or related technical field.
Industry experience working on projects such as: real-time SLAM and 3D reconstruction, sensor fusion and active depth sensing, object and body tracking and pose estimation, and/or image processing. Image and/or semantic segmentation, 2D and 3D key point estimation and surface reconstruction, depth estimation, generative methods such as GANs, or photorealistic rendering

About Meta:

Meta builds technologies that help people connect, find communities, and grow businesses. When Facebook launched in 2004, it changed the way people connect. Apps like Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp further empowered billions around the world. Now, Meta is moving beyond 2D screens toward immersive experiences like augmented and virtual reality to help build the next evolution in social technology. People who choose to build their careers by building with us at Meta help shape a future that will take us beyond what digital connection makes possible today—beyond the constraints of screens, the limits of distance, and even the rules of physics.",

About Rhino Health
AI has not achieved its full potential in healthcare. Rhino Health aims to fix that. Today, AI developers face tremendous hurdles in training their models on sufficiently large and diverse datasets because of privacy concerns. Rhino Health’s Federated Computing Platform (FCP) unlocks healthcare data collaborations by allowing developers to train their models on data without ever taking possession of that data.
 Rhino Health offers healthcare organizations and data scientists an end-to-end distributed computing platform, which enables data collaboration while protecting patient data privacy. This platform uses edge computing and federated learning, leaving data at rest at each site, thus lowering the barrier to wider adoption of AI in healthcare and making multi-site collaboration seamless. Users can collaborate with a network of dozens of leading medical centers around the world, centrally performing data pre-processing, harmonization, model training & validation, and results analysis with no patient data ever leaving any medical center’s firewall.
 The company is headquartered in Boston, with an R&D center in Tel Aviv.

About the role
The Senior Frontend Engineer will lead all aspect of our Frontend and will be responsible for enhancing and scaling the user interface of Rhino Health’s Federated Computing Platform (FCP). This web-based user interface is the gateway to FCP, which users interact with regularly in order to execute cutting edge AI/ML research and development for healthcare, ultimately driving a shift in healthcare innovation and delivery. You will be the bridge between the frontend and the backend development of the company and will help shape the future of FCP and of Rhino Health in general. Day-to-day, your role will be architecting, designing, and developing frontend components, working closely with the backend engineers and UX designers. This role is for a player-coach who can both lead and build out our frontend team as well as perform hands-on development. 
Create a vision for the FCP’s frontend and how it will scale as the company scales along different axes. Translate this vision into annual, quarterly, and sprint-level plans.
Take entire frontend components from ideation through design, implementation, and deployment, working closely with Product, UX Design, and other engineers on the team.
Enhance the scalability of our frontend codebase and the infrastructure supporting the frontend development.
Manage the frontend team (currently one part-time frontend engineer) and later on build out the frontend team as it grows.

About the candidate
