Description

Do you want to solve business challenges through innovative technology? Do you enjoy working on cutting-edge, scalable services technology in a team environment? Do you like working on industry-defining projects that move the needle?

At Amazon, we hire the best minds in technology to innovate and build on behalf of our customers. The intense focus we have on our customers is why we are one of the world's most beloved brands - customer obsession is part of our company DNA. Our interns write real software and collaborate with a selected group of experienced software development engineers who help interns on projects that matter to our customers.

We want to you to feel welcomed, included and valued right from the start. Every day will be filled with exciting new challenges, developing new skills, and achieving personal growth.

In addition to working on an impactful project, you will have the opportunity to engage with Amazonians for both personal and professional development, expand your network, and participate in activities with other interns throughout your internship. No matter the location of your internship, we give you the tools to own your project and learn in a real-world setting. Many of our technologies overlap, and you would be hard pressed to find a team that is not using Amazon Web Services (AWS), touching the catalogue, or iterating services to better personalise for customers. We make the impossible, possible.

Tonkean is the world’s first totally customizable process experience platform. With Tonkean, you can create intelligent, personalized automations that integrate with every app or system your organization uses. You can cultivate an employee experience that democratizes access to innovative technologies traditionally only available to highly trained developers. You can enable employees to focus more fully on high-value tasks, because you can enable them to automate low-value tasks. You can create inbox solutions that automatically analyze, prioritize, and route unstructured requests coming from any source, and you can track the status of action items as employees collaborate across teams to complete them. And you can design processes that employees are guaranteed to adopt and benefit from no matter their technical acumen, because Tonkean meets employees where they are—eliminating the need for change management—and is 100% no-code.

At Tonkean, we believe that all this—compliance, efficiency, operational excellence—requires high levels of process adoption. But to ensure high levels of process adoption, you need to create processes that provide a great employee experience: that serve employees’ needs, understand their preferences, and solve their problems.

We are looking for a driven, team-driven, and excellent Senior Software Engineer to join our team!

Develop our product and features end-to-end, from architecture design to implementation and from database to client-side.
Solve diverse complex problems on high-scale, cutting edge systems.
Collaborate with Design, Product, QA and Development teams to deliver an amazing product.
Work closely with business users and feel the immediate impact of your implementations.
Help us design and implement a product for business operations to design the future of work and impact companies and people all over the world.

ABOUT YOU:
You have at least 5 years of programming experience, with any of the following- Java/ C#/ .net/ Scala/ Go/ Python/ Node.js and React
You’re a full stack developer experienced in all aspects of client-server architecture, design, and implementation.
You have experience with web technologies, such as HTML5, CSS3, TypeScript.
You have experience with SQL/NoSQL technologies like MySQL, ElasticSearch, etc.
You’re passionate about working in a startup environment.
You’re a team player and a self-starter, with a high level of auto-deduction & self-management. You are creative, motivated, and a hard worker.
You believe that there is always a way and nothing is impossible.
You always try to understand the “Why” and you believe that it’s only a failure if you didn’t learn anything from it.
Excellent communication skills.

OUR VALUES
There Is Always A Way. At Tonkean, we believe that nothing is impossible There is a solution to every problem - you just need to find it.

Think People First. We believe in investing in, empowering, and prioritizing people. We work as a team and win as a team. We listen with purpose as we speak with courage. We believe in diversity. We always ask ourselves: Is this giving value to our customers? Is this improving our team? Is this helping me be better?

Start With Why And Fail Fast. We believe that progress is the only way forward; that action is always better than no action; that innovation requires bravery. We believe that every worthwhile “how” starts with an important “why.” If you know the “why”, and you can learn from it, It’s never a failure. It is the operational cost of progress.

No BS. To matter, you must - stay focused, keep it simple and always move the needle. We don’t have time for BS. We don’t waste energy; we prioritize efficiency; we stay focused; and we always try to optimize for what’s important.\

Summary:

Are you interested in working on a product that scales? Do you want to be given the time to measure whether that cache is meaningful? What about getting to pick your own tools (and even write them when necessary)? If so, keep reading…

What this role is:

You will be working as part of a delivery team that builds microservices on top of AWS. You will help build and maintain the services that power our workforce management product line. You will help support existing EC2 and Lambda services in production. You will continuously deploy your own code without downtime.

What you will bring to the table:

You should be a lifelong learner who can work well within a team. You should be a strong problem solver who can debug complex customer situations one day and build out new scalable code the next. You should be detail-oriented, be smart, and get things done.

Key Responsibilities:

Develop and maintain cloud applications that will be used by millions of agents
Implement new features through agile development practices.
Support production environment inquiries and issues.
Deliver resilient, scalable, and maintainable cloud applications built on AWS.
Provide feedback on team processes, architecture, and infrastructure
Explore innovative technologies to support continuous improvement.

Minimum Requirements:

BS in Computer Science or Software Engineering (or very strong relevant experience)
2+ years of related work experience in front-end, back-end or full-stack development.
Working experience with OOP language or JavaScript/Python utilizing OOP concept.
Good verbal and written communication skills.
Experience working with JavaScript frameworks such as Vue/React/Angular is a plus.
Experience working with Amazon Web Services such as EC2, S3, CloudFormation, CloudWatch, Lambda, DynamoDB, SQS, SNS, Kafka, Redis is a plus.

Think People First. We believe in investing in, empowering, and prioritizing people. We work as a team and win as a team. We listen with purpose as we speak with courage. We believe in diversity. We always ask ourselves: Is this giving value to our customers? Is this improving our team? Is this helping me be better?

Start With Why And Fail Fast. We believe that progress is the only way forward; that action is always better than no action; that innovation requires bravery. We believe that every worthwhile “how” starts with an important “why.” If you know the “why”, and you can learn from it, It’s never a failure. It is the operational cost of progress.

No BS. To matter, you must - stay focused, keep it simple and always move the needle. We don’t have time for BS. We don’t waste energy; we prioritize efficiency; we stay focused; and we always try to optimize for what’s important.\

Tonkean welcomes everyone. We believe every member of our team enriches our diversity and inclusion by broadening our ways of problem-solving for future challenges. Even if you don't meet 100% of the qualifications for this job, we strongly encourage you to apply.",

Summary:

Are you interested in working on a product that scales? Do you want to be given the time to measure whether that cache is meaningful? What about getting to pick your own tools (and even write them when necessary)? If so, keep reading…

What this role is:

You will be working as part of a delivery team that builds microservices on top of AWS. You will help build and maintain the services that power our workforce management product line.

You should be a lifelong learner who can work well within a team. You should be a strong problem solver who can debug complex customer situations one day and build out new scalable code the next. You should be detail-oriented, be smart, and get things done.

Key Responsibilities:

Develop and maintain cloud applications that will be used by millions of agents
Implement new features through agile development practices.
Support production environment inquiries and issues.
Deliver resilient, scalable, and maintainable cloud applications built on AWS.
Provide feedback on team processes, architecture, and infrastructure
Explore innovative technologies to support continuous improvement.

Minimum Requirements:

BS in Computer Science or Software Engineering (or very strong relevant experience)
2+ years of related work experience in front-end, back-end or full-stack development.
Working experience with OOP language or JavaScript/Python utilizing OOP concept.
Good verbal and written communication skills.
Experience working with JavaScript frameworks such as Vue/React/Angular is a plus.
Experience working with Amazon Web Services such as EC2, S3, CloudFormation, CloudWatch, Lambda, DynamoDB, SQS, SNS, Kafka, Redis is a plus.

We created the first end-to-end TransitTech solution for cities and transit agencies, offering world-class software, service design, and operational expertise to fundamentally improve the way the world moves.

Via was founded with the guiding principle that we go further when we go together. We are dedicated to building a diverse, inclusive and authentic workplace.

Open source is our beating heart and it’s something that fuels our work and our culture. It’s where we began. It’s where we’ll always be. Our vision is to become the trusted open source data platform for everyone. We are a Cast of over 400 individuals (‘Crabs’) located across the globe. Why Crabs? Because we believe in thinking sideways. And right now, we’re looking for sideways-thinking Senior Software Engineer.

The Engineering team at Aiven lies at the core of our organization. This is a great opportunity to become an integral team member as a Senior Backend Engineer..

We look for engineers who can work around problems by finding new angles. That means both creative and lateral approaches. Thinking sideways.

You will have the opportunity to collaborate with world-class tech people solving the toughest problems, where almost every project you work on is more complex and technically challenging than the previous one.

If you relish pushing your technical boundaries, come join us. Because if you can truly think sideways, you’ll never look back.

Who we are

So, how do we become the trusted open source data platform for everyone? By listening closely to our customers and taking action to ensure they achieve their business goals. You see, the software we create is merely a means of delivering value. Our thinking is customer-first. That’s why our customers are at the front and center of all we do. And in the spirit of sideways thinking, we’re by their side as well. Actively helping them solve their challenges. Collaborating. Sharing. And innovating. In other words, it really isn’t just about who we are. It’s about who our customers are – and where they want to be.

Our values

We want individuals who can embody our values of ownership, courage, and openness.

What does that mean in practice?

We take ownership of the problems we solve. What we do is about improving life for our customers, enabling them to meet their goals. So we own our decisions and mistakes. Sometimes that takes courage. But we don’t falter – we take on challenges with confidence. And right at our heart is openness. We’re always open to new ideas – from wherever and whoever they come.

The Role:

We’re hiring a Senior Backend Engineer for Aiven’s EverSQL. EverSQL offers an AI-powered database optimization platform, allowing customers to accelerate their data workflows, while also reducing costs. Already trusted by more than 100,000 software engineers, the solution reduces development time and saves the cost of database experts by using automatic optimization algorithms for database query tuning, index recommendations and more. EverSQL supports a variety of databases, including PostgreSQL®, MySQL® and more.

We are looking for an experienced engineer to work on our database optimization platform. You’ll be part of a development team in our databases and AI domain. Our backend systems are mostly implemented in Python and Java, with bits of Go and C

Our way of working is to focus on delivery, solving customer problems and to innovate, to be open, respectful and collaborative, and avoiding overhead, leveraging async, written communication instead of sitting in long meetings.

What You'll Do:

Writing high quality, maintainable code and releasing quality features
Performing peer reviews and participating in technical discussions both at the team level and engineering level
Contributing to technical planning and backlog management
Helping investigate and resolve customer issues
Mentor and empower other engineers around you

What We're Looking For:

Don’t worry if your experience doesn’t line up perfectly – we still encourage you to apply! We believe in investing in our crabs’ professional growth.

Must-have:

Excellent development skills in Python / Java
Excellent understanding of SQL and databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, OpenSearch)
Ability to write good automated tests
Experience using Linux in development
Fluency in English, verbal and written

Nice to have:

Distributed systems knowledge
Experience in infrastructure as code

Our Offer

If you ask us what’s the best thing about working for Aiven, many will probably say it’s the high concentration of talent from around the world that we have here. Enjoy the agile environment of a hyperscale scale-up where you can truly make an impact and have fun while at it.

We invest in you

Participate in Aiven’s equity plan.
With Aiven locations spanning the globe, we want all of our crabs to find the right balance with our hybrid work policy.
Get the equipment you need to set yourself up for success.
Step up your career game with real employer support (use one of our learning platforms, annual learning budget, and more).
Get holistic wellbeing support through our global Employee Assistance Program.

Make a difference at Aiven

Use up to 5 days per year to volunteer for a good cause of your choice.
Join one of our team member resource groups - empower yourself and others in missions that resonate with you.

Open source is our beating heart and it’s something that fuels our work and our culture. It’s where we began. It’s where we’ll always be. Our vision is to become the trusted open source data platform for everyone. We are a Cast of over 400 individuals (‘Crabs’) located across the globe. Why Crabs? Because we believe in thinking sideways. And right now, we’re looking for sideways-thinking Senior FullStack Engineer

The Engineering team at Aiven lies at the core of our organization. This is a great opportunity to become an integral team member as a Senior FullStack Engineer.

We look for engineers who can work around problems by finding new angles. That means both creative and lateral approaches. Thinking sideways.

You will have the opportunity to collaborate with world-class tech people solving the toughest problems, where almost every project you work on is more complex and technically challenging than the previous one.

If you relish pushing your technical boundaries, come join us. Because if you can truly think sideways, you’ll never look back.

Who we are

So, how do we become the trusted open source data platform for everyone? By listening closely to our customers and taking action to ensure they achieve their business goals. You see, the software we create is merely a means of delivering value. Our thinking is customer-first. That’s why our customers are at the front and center of all we do. And in the spirit of sideways thinking, we’re by their side as well. Actively helping them solve their challenges. Collaborating. Sharing. And innovating. In other words, it really isn’t just about who we are. It’s about who our customers are – and where they want to be.

Our values

We want individuals who can embody our values of ownership, courage, and openness.

What does that mean in practice?

We take ownership of the problems we solve. What we do is about improving life for our customers, enabling them to meet their goals. So we own our decisions and mistakes. Sometimes that takes courage. But we don’t falter – we take on challenges with confidence. And right at our heart is openness. We’re always open to new ideas – from wherever and whoever they come.

The Role:

We’re hiring a Senior FullStack Engineer for EverSQL by Aiven. EverSQL offers an AI-powered database optimization platform, allowing customers to accelerate their data workflows, while also reducing costs. Already trusted by more than 100,000 software engineers, the solution reduces development time and saves the cost of database experts by using automatic optimization algorithms for database query tuning, index recommendations and more. EverSQL supports a variety of databases, including PostgreSQL®, MySQL® and more.

We are looking for an experienced engineer to work on our database optimization platform. You’ll be part of a development team in our databases and AI domain. Our backend systems are mostly implemented in Python and Java, with bits of Go and C

Our way of working is to focus on delivery, solving customer problems and to innovate, to be open, respectful and collaborative, and avoiding overhead, leveraging async, written communication instead of sitting in long meetings.

What You'll Do:

Writing high quality, maintainable code and releasing quality features
Performing peer reviews and participating in technical discussions both at the team level and engineering level
Contributing to technical planning and backlog management
Helping investigate and resolve customer issues
Mentor and empower other engineers around you

What We're Looking For:

Don’t worry if your experience doesn’t line up perfectly – we still encourage you to apply! We believe in investing in our crabs’ professional growth.

Must-have:

Excellent development skills in Python, Java, TypeScript, React and Redux
Excellent understanding of SQL and databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, OpenSearch)
Ability to independently solve challenges, break tasks and push to desired outcome
Ability to write good automated tests
Experience using Linux in development
Fluency in English, verbal and written

Nice to have:

Distributed systems knowledge

Our Offer

If you ask us what’s the best thing about working for Aiven, many will probably say it’s the high concentration of talent from around the world that we have here. Enjoy the agile environment of a hyperscale scale-up where you can truly make an impact and have fun while at it.

We invest in you

Participate in Aiven’s equity plan.
With Aiven locations spanning the globe, we want all of our crabs to find the right balance with our hybrid work policy.
Get the equipment you need to set yourself up for success.
Step up your career game with real employer support (use one of our learning platforms, annual learning budget, and more).
Get holistic wellbeing support through our global Employee Assistance Program.

Make a difference at Aiven

Contribute to open source projects that you find meaningful outside of work - and get paid for it. Our Plankton program recognizes extra work to the open source ecosystem for developers and non-developers alike.
Use up to 5 days per year to volunteer for a good cause of your choice.
Join one of our team member resource groups - empower yourself and others in missions that resonate with you.

What else

As well as the above Global Benefits, we have regional benefits specific to your country of residence. We would be happy to discuss these further with you during the interview process.

Amazing, What’s next

If you think Aiven is the place for you, send us your CV, and we’ll get in touch.

Playrix — одна из самых успешных компаний по разработке мобильных игр в мире. По доходам среди всех мобильных приложений мы входим в топ-3 в мире, а в Европе мы первые. Наши игры установили 2,3 миллиарда раз (треть населения Земли), каждый день в них играет более 30 миллионов людей по всему миру!
У нас большие планы на развитие и рост наших проектов, именно поэтому мы ищем сильнейших экспертов в наши команды разработки.

Команды разработки для нас - ядро компании, благодаря которому наши игры растут и развиваются уже 19 лет.

Lead Software Engineer – драйвер технического развития продукта, который ведет и развивает команду с точки зрения архитектуры, качества, культуры разработки и инженерных практик.

В каждом проекте у нас есть основные направления: 

фичевое: разработка событий и мини-игр с нуля (от различных соревнований до мини-игр типа Merge);
техническое: оптимизация, поддержка технической стабильности, SDK (сокращение скорости загрузки, потребление памяти и др.);
match-3 и мета: работа с графикой и основной механикой игры (добавление нового функционала, рефакторинг и оптимизация).

Задачи, которые предстоит решать: 

people management: ответственность за развитие, найм/увольнение, оценку команды;
развитие процессов внутри команд (как на уровне команды, так и на уровне всей разработки на проекте);
продюсирование: решение сложных технических проблем на проектах, разработка архитектуры решения и обеспечение быстрой реализации;
контроль стабильности и качества программной части игры;
code review и design review;
программирование и рефакторинг игровой логики.

Наш стек:

языки: С++, для единичных задач Lua и Python;
графика: OpenGL ES и Metal;
собственный движок, похожий на Unity или Unreal, который мы постоянно развиваем;
продвинутый CI/CD, автоматическое тестирование, процессы code review и многое другое.

Мы ожидаем:

опыт управления командой программистов (3+ человек) не менее года;
опыт разработки проектов, выпущенных в production;
опыт разработки коммерческих проектов на С++ не менее 3 лет.

Будет плюсом:

уверенное владение современными стандартами С++ 14/17, а также STL;
опыт работы с популярными игровыми движками (Unity, Unreal, Godot, Cocos2D, Defold и т.д.);
опыт разработки мобильных казуальных игр.

У нас классно, потому что у нас есть:

Открытая коммуникация и прозрачность в принятии решений, обмен опытом внутри команд.
Фокус на качестве и надежности кода.
Упор на развитие продуктового видения у каждого специалиста в компании. Наши разработчики представляют, как та или иная фича будет работать у пользователя, и сами играют в игры, которые разрабатывают.
Возможность менять процессы и подходы на более эффективные без долгих согласований и бюрократии.
Понятные возможности развития в технического директора, программинг менеджера или проджект менеджера.

Мы предлагаем:

Гибкость в работе: у нас гибкий график, и сотрудники могут работать из любой точки мира (кроме РФ и РБ). Для нас не важно, где и как вы выполняете свою работу — мы оцениваем только результаты.
Забота о здоровье и well-being:
Предоставляем ДМС для сотрудников и их детей, компенсируем онлайн-сессии с психологом.
Сохраняем 100% зарплату во время отпуска или больничного без лишних справок. А для особых случаев предоставляем дополнительные выходные.
Поддерживаем здоровый образ жизни и компенсируем покупку спортивных абонементов и подписку на фитнес-приложения.
Развитие и обучение:
Оплачиваем участие в профильных конференциях и курсах, проводим внутренние конференции.
Предлагаем скидки на курсы английского языка и языков стран присутствия компании.

HUMAN was founded in 2012 in a Brooklyn sci-fi bookstore by Tamer Hassan, Michael Tiffany, Dan Kaminsky, and Ash Kalb. Our humble beginnings led to the creation of the Human Defense Platform, the backbone of all our products that safeguards enterprises from sophisticated bots, fraud, and account abuse. Today we verify the humanity of more than 20 trillion interactions per week for some of the largest companies and internet platforms. 

Our hacker roots still permeate everything we do. You will be a part of the HUMAN front line in our commitment to protecting companies (and in turn, their customers) from both revenue and reputation risk caused by digital attacks. However, HUMAN is not the center of this story. Humans like yourself are. We firmly believe in putting people first. This approach spans our extensive total rewards package, inclusive of competitive compensation, benefits, stipends - as well as our day-to-day culture - to ensure every human is empowered to do the best work of their life. We want to hear about the marathon you’re training for. We want to see pictures of your pets. We want to know your favorite robot (we have many).

 Even if you’re not a conventional “hacker” we can assure you that you are a hacker in your own right. We want to work with people like you who break down problems to build up better solutions. That’s what makes us HUMAN. You’ll be joining us at an exciting moment in the HUMAN story: we joined forces with PerimeterX in a market-changing merger , as well as recently acquired clean.io to enhance the Human Defense Platform. Together under the HUMAN brand, we will disrupt the economics of cybercrime. We hope you can join us in that mission.

We’re looking for a strong ML engineer to join our team and help lead the development of our ML infrastructure. If you’re passionate about ML, Python and high-scale big-data environments, come join the team!

What you'll do:

Lead the development of our ML Ops infrastructure, creating processes that support ML projects in the company from their development phase until their deployment to production and beyond.
Build and support an infrastructure for real-time model inference at scale, serving billions of requests each day.
Implement data-based processes and solutions processing massive amounts of data as part of our ML pipelines.
Work closely with our data scientists to deliver new projects, define processes and coding standards and gather requirements to further develop our infra.
Design and implement pipelines integrating ML models and prediction results into our core products.
Be the go-to person for any Python or ML Ops related question or idea, being a focal point for both our Research and engineering teams.


Who you are:

5+ years of backend development in Python. 
Has experience developing ML Ops processes or supporting ML models in production.
Experienced with big-data, high-scale environments. 
Familiar with cloud vendors concepts and tools, preferably working on top of one in prior positions.
Team player with good verbal and written communication skills. 
Passionate about technology, fast learner and eager to lead and take ownership of big projects end-to-end.
Prior experience working with GCP - advantage.
Golang knowledge and experience - advantage.
Experience with Vertex AI and Kubeflow pipelines - advantage.


HUMAN prides itself on being an equal opportunity workplace. We firmly believe in putting people first regardless of who you are, where you come from, how you identify, or who your favorite robot is (we have many). We are on a mission to protect the integrity of the internet for everyone, so we welcome all individuals to come to share their unique experiences and perspectives as we fight against cybercrime together!

With Humans located in all parts of the world, we’ve fully embraced our diversity of thought and are always looking for innovative ways to connect with one another - even in virtual reality! Although New York City is our HQ, we have teams in Tel Aviv, Israel; London, UK; Victoria, Canada; San Mateo, CA; Miami, FL; and Virginia.

We trust our Humans in choosing where they work and how they work. The total rewards package we provide reflects our commitment to our Humans’ personal career development, which includes annual stipends for home office setup, wellbeing, and learning & development. We also offer weekly lunches, flexible time off, no-meeting Fridays (for our U.S. and Intl. based HUMANs), HUMAN days, and so much more.

We’re constantly trying to anticipate the needs of our Humans to ensure each one of us is equally prepared to do some of the best work of our life. Taking care of one another is part of the HUMAN experience and how we build true HUMAN connections.

Возможность переходить между направлениями и не только в рамках разработки (Project Management, маркетинг и т.д.).
Задачи, требующие умения принимать эффективные и безопасные архитектурные решения, а также применять на практике интересные подходы программирования.
Возможность менять процессы и подходы на более эффективные без долгих согласований и бюрократии.

Мы предлагаем:

Гибкость в работе: у нас гибкий график, и сотрудники могут работать из любой точки мира (кроме РФ и РБ). Для нас не важно, где и как вы выполняете свою работу — мы оцениваем только результаты.
Забота о здоровье и well-being:
Предоставляем ДМС для сотрудников и их детей, компенсируем онлайн-сессии с психологом.
Сохраняем 100% зарплату во время отпуска или больничного без лишних справок. А для особых случаев предоставляем дополнительные выходные.

About the role:

The Identity Group stands at the core of Forter’s competitive edge in the market. The group is in charge of creating the engine that identifies clients and builds Forter’s knowledge of them. Due to its criticality, Forter’s identity engine is a focal point from both a business and a technical perspective. That centrality means that we are always looking for new ways to make the engine faster, easier to modify, with higher throughput, and better accuracy.

We're looking for a talented Senior Data Engineer to join the Identity Data team. The team is in charge of the critical data pipeline that processes and aggregates the huge quantity of events that, over time, build Forter’s identity data corpus.

The story told from a technical perspective:

 >2 billion person entities stored jointly in various database engines to support different fetching requirements (e.g. Elasticsearch, Aerospike, Redis, S3, Snowflake, RocksDB)
Providing service to all Forter decisions, generating some of the most critical model inputs
The most major contributor to Forter’s decision latency, a big part of the decision cost. Making high-risk / high-reward investments in cutting edge technologies to optimize at the core of business
Over 200k events per second are being processed by our recognition engine which has to remain super cheap (Elasticsearch backed) 
Many analysts all around the organization that research our data and work hard at bettering it

The team (as the whole group) is almost entirely non-functional metrics driven. Most of our efforts go into improving precision, latency, throughput, and cost efficiency. This means engineers are required for a high level of technical skill and a keen sense for performance and cost efficiency. It also means that engineering initiatives represent a very large portion (>50%) of what we do.

What you'll be doing:

Design, Build, and Maintain Near-real-time Event Ingress Pipelines: Take the lead in architecting, developing, and ensuring the ongoing operation of sophisticated event ingress pipelines that handle vast amounts of data in near-real time
Partake in Setting Technical Strategy: Contribute your expertise to shaping the technical strategy for the detection domain, participating in discussions that set the course for our technology's future.
Lead Development Efforts: Drive major development initiatives, from concept to deployment, ensuring the successful execution of projects that enhance the speed, accuracy, and efficiency of our systems.
Identify Pains and Promote Solutions: Analyze the systems to identify pain points and inefficiencies. Develop and implement effective solutions that streamline processes, enhance productivity, and elevate the overall performance of the event ingress pipelines.

What you'll need:

6+ years of professional software engineering experience
Extensive background in backend engineering, with a focus on JVM
Experience working with and maintaining distributed production databases
Excellent communication and interpersonal skills
Fluent in spoken and written English

It'd be cool if you also: [not a must]

Work experience in teams that maintain an engine rather than a product
Experience with event streaming frameworks
Strong Python skills
